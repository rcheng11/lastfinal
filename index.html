                    Past policies have already tried both 
                    a mano dura approach and a reformist approach.
                     However, alone they both have failed for their

                    The current abuse of the state of emergency,

                    gang problem. Approaches vary, but should 
                    seek to rein in gang violence without resorting 
                    to indiscriminate state violence. The 
                    influence of pandillas in El Salvador is 
                    no joke:
                    <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/central-america/el-salvador/64-el-salvadors-politics-perpetual-violence">
                        there are more pandilleros than 
                    police and at least 8% of the population 
                    are calmados, a term used for their sympathizers 
                    and former members.
                    </a>  That’s why some argue that 
                    negotiations can’t be avoided. Instead, some argue 
                    that negotiations (between governments and pandillas) 
                    can be used to rein in the violence while the government 
                    takes steps to destabilize the pandillas and bring lasting 
                    reform that can end El Salvador’s cycle of violence.
